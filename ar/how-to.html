      <h1>How does the app work?</h1>
      <p>This application is a digital wallet that can send and receive money in the form of <a href="http://help.hopestarter.org/en/bitcoin">bitcoin</a>.</p>
      <p>With this app you also create a profile in our platform and can publish your story, current circumstances and needs to the world.</p>
      <p>People can find these stories in the <a href="http://hopestarter.org/">Hopestarterâ€™s website</a> and donate bitcoins to the person they want to help (you!), directly, in seconds. This is a transaction just between the donor and the refugee, with no intermediaries. 100% of the money donated to you will reach you.</p>
