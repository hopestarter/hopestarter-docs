      <h1>About us</h1>
      <p>Hopestarter is a non-profit organization aiming to transform humanitarian aid by enabling refugees receiving direct aid in cash from anyone in the world.</p>
      <p>Cash is the most effective way to help someone. It gives people the choice to acquire what each one really needs. And it helps refugees integrate faster in societies by participating and helping the local economies.</p>
      <p>But how can someone donate directly to a refugee? You can’t just Google them and probably you won’t see them in your Facebook feed. And even if you do, how can you send them money if they don’t even have bank accounts?</p>
      <p>At Hopestarter we’re trying to solve this very problem <a href="http://help.hopestarter.org/en/how-to">with the use of the <strong>internet</strong> and <strong>bitcoin</strong></a>. Our vision is to make supporting someone halfway around the world easier than helping your next door neighbor.</p>
