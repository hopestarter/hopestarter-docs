      <h1>What is bitcoin?</h1>
      <p>Bitcoin is the most popular digital currency. The basic idea is that you can use it to <a href="http://help.hopestarter.org/en/merchants">pay for things</a> without a third-party broker, like a bank or government.</p>
      <p>Bitcoins are stored in “digital wallets” apps like Hopestarter, which exists either in the cloud or on a user’s phone or computer. Wallets are a kind of virtual bank account that allows users to send or receive bitcoins, pay for goods or save their money. It is possible to have more than one wallet and transfer your bitcoins from one to another.</p>
      <p>Here’s a list with the most important features you need to know about bitcoin:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p><strong>It's decentralized:</strong> The bitcoin network isn’t controlled by one central authority. Every machine that mines bitcoin and processes transactions makes up a part of the network, and the machines work together.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>It's easy to set up:</strong> Conventional banks make you jump through hoops simply to open a bank account. But you can set up a bitcoin address in seconds, no questions asked, and with no fees payable.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>It's anonymous:</strong> Well, kind of. Users can hold multiple bitcoin addresses, and they aren’t linked to names, addresses, or other personally identifying information.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>It's completely transparent:</strong> Bitcoin stores details of every single transaction that ever happened in the network in a huge version of a general ledger, called the blockchain. If you have a publicly used bitcoin address, anyone can tell how many bitcoins are stored at that address. They just don’t know that it’s yours.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Transaction fees are miniscule:</strong> A bank may charge you high fees when you transfer money. Bitcoin transaction fees on the other hand are voluntary and extremely low, and act mostly as an incentive on the part of the bitcoin user to make sure that a particular transaction is processed quickly by the bitcoin network.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>It’s fast:</strong> You can send money anywhere and it will arrive minutes later, as soon as the bitcoin network processes the payment.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>It’s non-repudiable:</strong> When your bitcoins are sent, there’s no getting them back, unless the recipient returns them to you. They’re gone forever.</p></li>
      </ol>
      <p>People can acquire bitcoins in the following 3 ways:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Mining:</strong> People compete to “mine” bitcoins using computers to solve complex math puzzles. This is how bitcoins are created.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Buying on an Exchange:</strong> Several marketplaces called “bitcoin exchanges” allow people to buy or sell bitcoins using different currencies. Also bitcoin ATMs exist - you put money in, and the machine sends bitcoins to your mobile wallet.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Transfers:</strong> People can send bitcoins to each other using mobile apps or their computers.</p></li>
      </ol>
